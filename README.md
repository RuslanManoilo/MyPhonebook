# MyPhonebook APP

The contact book developed on React using Redux, private routes, and public
routes. It's a web-based application that enables users to save their phone
contacts' information.

The application stores the contact information on the server, and the user must
be authorised to add contacts to their repository, which adds an additional
layer of security to the application.

React allows you to use two types of routes: public and private. The public
route allows users to view Home and Authorisation pages. The private route
requires users to be logged in to access all of the app's features, including
the ability to add, delete, and filter contacts.

The application's robust features and user-friendly interface help users manage
their phone contacts effectively.
